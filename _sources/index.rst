	<p>Welcome to Mobile CS Principles!</p>
	
	<p>Mobile Computer Science Principles (<a target="_blank" href="http://mobile-csp.org">Mobile CSP</a>) is an NSF-funded effort to provide a broad and rigorous introduction to computer science based on MIT App Inventor, a programming language for creating apps for mobile devices.  Mobile CSP is a program of the <a href="http://www.css.edu/csed" target="_blank">National Center for Computer Science Education</a>. Mobile CSP is an approved curriculum provider for the College Board's  Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles curriculum framework for introductory computer science.</p>
	
	<p>In Mobile CSP you will learn computer science by building socially useful mobile apps.  In addition to programming and computer science principles, Mobile CSP is project-based and emphasizes writing, communication, collaboration, and creativity. </p>

	ATTENTION high school women of color taking AP CSP or CSA: if you identify as female and as Black, Hispanic/Latina, and/or Native American, apply to participate in **Sisters Rise Up**. The goal of Sisters Rise Up is to help you succeed in your AP Computer Science course and on the exam. They offer one-hour help sessions several times a week and once a month special help sessions often with guest speakers from computing.  If you enroll in Sisters Rise Up and send in your AP CS exam score by the end of August, you will be sent a gift card for $100. See the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11MDPfpb3sjzfCR-6zeUe79WNgBbfZbqN/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">flyer</a>  and apply at  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/55z7tyb9" target="_blank">https://tinyurl.com/55z7tyb9</a>. </p>

    <p>ATTENTION high school women, genderqueer, and non-binary technologists: Apply Sept. 1st until Oct. 20th for the **NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing** to be recognized for all that you do (or want to do) in technology.

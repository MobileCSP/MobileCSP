	<p>Welcome to Mobile CS Principles!</p>
	
	<p>Mobile Computer Science Principles (<a target="_blank" href="http://mobile-csp.org">Mobile CSP</a>) is an NSF-funded effort to provide a broad and rigorous introduction to computer science based on MIT App Inventor, a programming language for creating apps for mobile devices.  Mobile CSP is a program of the <a href="http://www.css.edu/csed" target="_blank">National Center for Computer Science Education</a>. Mobile CSP is an approved curriculum provider for the College Board's  Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles curriculum framework for introductory computer science.</p>
	
	<p>In Mobile CSP you will learn computer science by building socially useful mobile apps.  In addition to programming and computer science principles, Mobile CSP is project-based and emphasizes writing, communication, collaboration, and creativity. </p>
	
	<p><span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold">UPDATE:</span> Mobile CSP is excited to be on Runestone Academy starting in August 2021! Read more about the transition at <a href="https://www.mobile-csp.org/migration" target="_blank">mobile-csp.org/migration</a>.</p>

	<p>Welcome to Mobile CS Principles!</p>
	
	<p>Mobile Computer Science Principles (<a target="_blank" href="http://mobile-csp.org">Mobile CSP</a>) is an NSF-funded effort to provide a broad and rigorous introduction to computer science based on MIT App Inventor, a programming language for creating apps for mobile devices.  Mobile CSP is a program of the <a href="http://www.css.edu/csed" target="_blank">National Center for Computer Science Education</a>. Mobile CSP is an approved curriculum provider for the College Board's  Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles curriculum framework for introductory computer science.</p>
	
	<p>In Mobile CSP you will learn computer science by building socially useful mobile apps.  In addition to programming and computer science principles, Mobile CSP is project-based and emphasizes writing, communication, collaboration, and creativity. </p>
	
	<p><span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold">UPDATE:</span> Mobile CSP is excited to be on Runestone Academy starting in August 2021! Read more about the transition at <a href="https://www.mobile-csp.org/migration" target="_blank">mobile-csp.org/migration</a>.</p>
	
	<p>ATTN: high school women, genderqueer, and non-binary technologists: Apply now for the NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing to be recognized for all that you do (or want to do) in technology. Visit <a href="http://www.aspirations.org/AiCHSAward" target="_blank">www.aspirations.org/AiCHSAward</a> for details. #NCWITAiC22 </p>

	<p>ATTN high school women of color taking AP CSA or CSP: Apply for Sisters Rise Up, a free online mentorship program for women of color (Black, Latina, and/or Native American) who are taking an AP CSA or CSP course during the 2021-2022 school year.  This program is part of a research project, Sisters Rise Up, which studies ways to help women of color succeed in AP CS.  It offers free remote help sessions led by undergraduate students from the University of Michigan. Two one-hour remote help sessions are offered most weeks and a two-three hour remote help session is offered once a month.  If you take the AP CS exam and send in your score by the end of August you will receive a $100 gift card.

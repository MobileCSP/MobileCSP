Explore Innovations Passage Questions (new)
===========================================

.. raw:: html

	<p>The AP CSP Exam has 5 questions devoted to a reading passage about a computing innovation. These questions are based on the Explore curricular activities in lessons 2.4, 2.6, 4.10 and the Impacts of CS lessons at the end of each unit. The multiple  choice questions will focus on data, purpose and effect, benefits and harms, and security concerns, and they assess Computational Thinking Practices 3 and 5 below.</p>
    <p>The reading passage will be 2-3 paragraphs explaining the computing innovation. An illustration, flowchart, or data may accompany the reading passage to provide details about an important element of the computing innovation.  It may be necessary to use the AP CSP Pseudocode or know common flowchart symbols.</p>
    
    <p>All 5 reading passage questions will be worded in a similar way. These are the possible types of questions (only five of these would be included on the exam):
    </p>
    <p> <b>Abstraction in Program Development (Computational Thinking Practices 3):</b></p>

    <ul>
    <li>Which of the following input data [must be obtained/is needed]...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following data is not [obtained/provided]...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following data is necessary for the...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following is [LEAST/MOST] likely to be included in...?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Computing Innovations (Computational Thinking Practices 5):</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Which of the following is considered a potential effect ofâ€¦ rather than a [function/purpose] of...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following is [LEAST/MOST] likely to be a [benefit/harm] of...?</li>

    <li>Which of the following may be an unintended effect of the use of...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following is the [LEAST/MOST] [likely/plausible] data [privacy/security/storage] concern of...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following groups is [LEAST/MOST] likely to...?</li>
    <li>Which of the following statements is [LEAST/MOST] likely to be true about the tradeoffs of...?</li>
    </ul>

	<p>Congratulations, you've completed the Mobile CSP course! You should now prepare to take the final exam.</p>
	<p>At this point, your instructor may have a final review sheet for you to review concepts in Units 1-7. Strategies for reviewing include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Read through your portfolio entries, asking questions where you were unsure of concepts.</li>
	<li>Review the quiz questions at the end of each lesson - ask questions if you're unsure of the correct answer.</li>
	<li>Review the apps you've created so far in the course.</li>
	</ul>
